## üìñ Overview

**Phantom Frequencies** is a unique turn-based puzzle game that bridges the gap between music theory and mathematics through interactive gameplay. The player defends their house from encroaching ghosts by composing melodies and understanding the mathematical principles behind musical intervals, chords, and scales. 

Unlike traditional rhythm games or music education apps, *Phantom Frequencies* offers a slow-paced, intellectually stimulating experience that emphasizes creative problem-solving and the theoretical foundations of music.

## üéØ Objectives

The game is designed with the following goals:

1. **Teach Music Theory through Math**  
   Players explore foundational concepts in music theory, including tones, intervals, and chord structures, by analyzing their mathematical underpinnings.

2. **Foster Creativity**  
   The game combines musical composition with mathematical problem-solving to create a unique and enjoyable learning environment.

3. **Accessible Learning**  
   By emphasizing sounds and visuals over traditional notation systems, the game is designed to be accessible to players with little or no musical experience.

## üß© Gameplay Mechanics

### üéÆ Core Gameplay Loop
Each level consists of a repeating three-phase cycle:

1. **Preparation Phase**  
   - Place or move instruments along a path.  
   - Adjust the pitch of each instrument to prepare for upcoming ghosts.  
   - Use visualization tools like oscilloscopes and harmonographs to analyze tones and predict how they‚Äôll interact.  

2. **Play Phase**  
   - Instruments activate sequentially, playing notes that target ghosts directly below them.  
   - Listen to your composition as it plays and see how it affects the ghosts.  

3. **Move Phase**  
   - Ghosts advance one step closer to your house.  
   - If three ghosts reach your house, it becomes haunted, and you lose the level.

### üëª Ghosts
Ghosts represent lost souls with unique musical preferences. To send them to the afterlife, players must meet their preferences, such as:  
- Specific intervals (e.g., a 5/4 frequency ratio).  
- Specific notes (e.g., C or F).  
- Chords (e.g., major or minor).  
- General qualities (e.g., consonant or dissonant sounds).  

Once their preferences are satisfied, they disappear into the afterlife, allowing the player to continue strategizing for the next wave.

### üéµ Instruments
Instruments are placed along a path and represent the notes the player can use to influence ghosts.  
- **Tones**: Represented both as frequencies and musical notation.  
- **Groups**: Instruments aligned vertically create chords, while those placed sequentially produce melodies.  
- **Constraints**: Instruments are simple, with no upgrades or additional attributes, ensuring gameplay stays focused on music theory.

### üîç Visualizer Tools
Two key tools help players analyze musical and mathematical relationships:  
1. **Oscilloscope Plot**: Visualizes the waveform of combined notes, showing how different tones interact.  
2. **Harmonograph**: Creates visual patterns from frequencies to demonstrate consonance, dissonance, and chord relationships.  

These tools help players bridge the gap between abstract concepts and practical application.

## üó∫Ô∏è Level Design & Pedagogy

Each level introduces new concepts in music theory while building on the previous ones. Players progress through topics such as:  
- Single notes and their frequencies.  
- Intervals, consonance, and dissonance.  
- Chords and their mathematical structures.  
- Keys and cohesive compositions.  

Levels are structured to gradually remove restrictions, allowing for greater complexity and freedom as players gain confidence and understanding.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation

The game is built using **Godot Engine**, chosen for its lightweight design and robust 2D capabilities. Here's an overview of the technical details:  

- **Audio**: Piano tones were generated using MuseScore for clarity and consistency.  
- **Node Architecture**: The modular design allowed for isolated development and testing of key components like ghosts, instruments, and UI elements.  
- **Challenges**:  
  - Lack of complex text rendering for math notation led to simplified representations.  
  - Limited strict typing required careful debugging and code management.
